# ESPNut-D1

[**ESPNut**](https://github.com/CIRCUITSTATE/ESPNut-D1) (pronounced as **"ee yes peanut"**) is a single-channel USB-to-Serial converter and Auto-Programmer for the ESP32 & ESP8266 series microcontrollers from Espressif. While there exists many such programmers, ESPNut is a completely open-source hardware (OSHW) project designed in the **KiCad** open-source EDA tool. You can download the source files of this design, modify them and redistribute them as you wish.

**D1** is the first design variant of the **ESPNut** project. Each design may go through different iterations to test the features, fix issues, or modify an existing feature. The basic features and form-factor of a design variant will remain almost same throughout the iterations. The latest revision is always considered as the optimum design. But you may use any other revisions as you wish.
